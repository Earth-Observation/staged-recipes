# If your package is python based, we recommend using Grayskull to generate it instead:

# Jinja variables help maintain the recipe as you'll update the version only here.
# Using the name variable with the URL in line 14 is convenient
# when copying and pasting from another recipe, but not really needed.

build:
  # Uncomment the following line if the package is pure Python and the recipe is exactly the same for all platforms.
  # It is okay if the dependencies are not built for all platforms/versions, although selectors are still not allowed.
  # See https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/knowledge_base.html#noarch-python for more details.
  # noarch: python
  # If the installation is complex, or different between Unix and Windows, use separate bld.bat and build.sh files instead of this key.
  # By default, the package will be built for the Python versions supported by conda-forge and for all major OSs.
  # Add the line "skip: True  # [py<35]" (for example) to limit to Python 3.5 and newer, or "skip: True  # [not win]" to limit to Windows.

about:
  home: https://github.com/jpy-consortium/jpy.git
  summary: 'jpy is a bi-directional Python-Java bridge which you can use to embed Java code in Python programs or the other way round. It has been designed particularly with regard to maximum data transfer speed between the two languages.'
  description: |
    It comes with a number of outstanding features:
    * Fully translates Java class hierarchies to Python
    * Transparently handles Java method overloading
    * Support of Java multi-threading
    * Fast and memory-efficient support of primitive Java array parameters via Python buffers (e.g. Numpy arrays)
    * Support of Java methods that modify primitive Java array parameters (mutable parameters)
    * Java arrays translate into Python sequence objects
    * Java API for accessing Python objects (jpy.jar)
